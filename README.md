# Customer Behavior Analysis and Lead Scoring

This project demonstrates how to combine web activity tracking and social media analysis to gain deeper insights into customer behavior. By integrating data from both sources, we develop a comprehensive view of customer interactions and use this data to predict customer conversion using a machine learning model. The project also shows how to integrate these insights with a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- textblob
- scikit-learn
- nltk

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git

## Install required Python packages:
    pip install
    pandas textblob 
    scikit-learn nltk

## Download necessary NLTK corpora:
    import nltk
    nltk.download('punkt')
    nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')

## Usage
1. **Prepare Sample Data:**
The script includes sample web activity data and social media data.

2. **Combine Data Sources:**
The script merges web activity data and social media data based on UserID.

3. **Sentiment Analysis:**
The script calculates sentiment for social media posts using TextBlob.

4. **Feature Engineering:**
The script aggregates web activity and social media data to create features such as total duration on the website, number of social media posts, and average sentiment.

5. **Model Training:**
The script trains a Random Forest classifier to predict customer conversion based on the engineered features.

6. **Model Evaluation:**
The script evaluates the model's performance and prints a classification report.

7. **CRM Integration:**
The script simulates the integration of insights with a CRM system by printing actionable insights for each user.
